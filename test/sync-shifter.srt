Hello everyone and welcome to this gamescon 2015 presentation of MGSV The Phantom Pain.

00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,340
Today, with just a month left til launch, we want to reveal the specifics of developing Snake's Mother Base

00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:30,780
and how you can manage Diamond Dogs to develop new equipment and abilities to support you while in the field.

00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:37,300
We'll also introduce you to the game's massively multiplayer online mode - the FOB system.

5
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,220
What you see here is Snake's new Mother Base - home of his new military force, Diamond Dogs.

6
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:52,040
As you gather personnel and resources you can expand the base, which will in-turn allow Diamond Dogs to support you in the field.
