Hello everyone and welcome to this gamescon 2015 presentation of MGSV The Phantom Pain.

00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:39,463
Today, with just a month left til launch, we want to reveal the specifics of developing Snake's Mother Base

3
00:00:39,463 --> 00:00:45,903
and how you can manage Diamond Dogs to develop new equipment and abilities to support you while in the field.

4
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:52,423
We'll also introduce you to the game's massively multiplayer online mode - the FOB system.

5
00:00:55,943 --> 00:01:01,343
What you see here is Snake's new Mother Base - home of his new military force, Diamond Dogs.

6
00:01:01,463 --> 00:01:07,163
As you gather personnel and resources you can expand the base, which will in-turn allow Diamond Dogs to support you in the field.
